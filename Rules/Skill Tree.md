Few, but powerful nodes.
Archetypal regions/sub-trees.
Str/Dex/Int chromatic regions; each archetype aligned with some combination.
Tree displayable either as a wheel or a strip separated by archetypes (for vertical display; horizontal scrolling).
Each archetype accessible through their corresponding root.
Archetypes may share tags/keywords, such that a single build can focus on a e.g. swordmagic by reaching both Dex/Int and Str/Dex archetypes.

### Roots
Based on race and background; they describe a character's origin.
Roots provide connections to the main skill tree.
Roots also provide a character's starting equipment.
Each root provides many options, for which you can choose one node.
- Characters have two root slots for race, so you can choose either Orc/Orc or Human/Orc and get an associated trait.
- For example, Orcs get the choice for a trait which connects you to a specific starting point on the tree, i.e. associated with Strength and Axes. Humans might instead get Strength/Dexterity and Spears.
- Characters have one root slot for their early life background.
- Characters have one root slot for their current background.
