All sources of danger, whether traps, spells or attacks, all have static values associated with their accuracy. They also have associated methods to avoid the effects.

These methods are as follows:
- Endure (Strength)
- Dodge (Dexterity)
- Resist (Intelligence)

```
Cleave attack
Attack DC: 15
Avoid: Endure(half), Dodge(null)

Attack hits up to three targets in front of the attacker. Pick a direction and sequentially hit these targets. If a target succesfully endures the attack, the attack ends early.
```
