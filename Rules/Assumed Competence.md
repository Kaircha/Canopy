Checks in Canopy assume characters are capable of successfully performing the task at all times. Dice are rolled not to determine whether you succeed, but to determine whether performing the action results in any consequences.

As an example, a group of two may be attempting to break into a general store cellar, because they believe something shady is going on down there. Character A has the skill to pick locks, so they will break in. There's two ways they may get away with this:
- Character A may make a check to avoid being heard.
- Character B may make a check to distract the storekeeper.
If either character succeeds, the check succeeds without consequences.

If a character does not have proficiency, both participants have disadvantage on avoiding the consequences of performing the action.
